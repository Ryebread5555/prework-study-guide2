# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## In this study guide I learned how to code with HTML, customize my guide with CSS, add JavaScript, and push everything to Git!

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I liked seeing my progress turn from nothing into a full webpage with color, images, and text.
- I built this project to help me make an easy study guide to come back to and keep track of key terms while practicing coding.
- It made it easy for me to keep all information in one spot.
- I brushed up on my HTML/CSS skills and learned intro steps into JavaScript. I also learned how to use console commands to easily save my files and push to Github.

## Usage

The usage of this Study Guide will help me remember certain key words for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I also learned how to use the DevTools Console to show that JavaScript is running. A lot of these topics I learned about will be key to my success in Bootcamp.
